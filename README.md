# BinaryRepair

BinaryRepair is a local analyst tool for repairing one known vulnerability in a
Linux x86-64 ELF **without original source**. Two independent repair routes
produce candidate bytes, and one deterministic acceptance engine decides whether
the final bytes are `success_within_scope`. A model explanation is never
evidence.

This is a curated public snapshot of the accepted project. The development
history and historical evidence remain in the source repository
[`chenfanaichifan/binary-repair`](https://github.com/chenfanaichifan/binary-repair).

## What it does

- **Route A** redirects the vulnerable call into a reviewed code cave.
- **Route B** recovers C, recompiles it, and re-integrates the function.
- A shared engine checks V0–V5 on the final candidate and returns
  `success_within_scope`, `inconclusive`, `rejected`, `unsupported`, `error`, or
  `cancelled`.
- The GUI/API only render verdicts; they never decide them.
- The host never executes uploaded or repaired binaries. Parsing, compilation,
  execution and symbolic analysis belong to the disposable guest under the
  broker.
- The workbench also accepts pasted source for static code repair (CWE-tagged
  findings, patch/diff, no execution), keeps task conversations server-side,
  and exposes a connector/tool inventory with install guides. See
  [`docs/architecture/code-repair.md`](docs/architecture/code-repair.md),
  [`docs/architecture/history.md`](docs/architecture/history.md) and
  [`docs/reference/binary-repair-landscape.md`](docs/reference/binary-repair-landscape.md).
  The workbench also ships a `/settings` preferences page, a complete `/guide`
  operator manual, task search/pin/rename, a composer `+` menu for local
  code/text files and vulnerable snippets, a `Ctrl/Cmd+K` command palette,
  nine UI languages, a responsive drawer sidebar and restrained page-transition
  effects. Language coverage and precision boundaries are documented in
  [`docs/reference/i18n.md`](docs/reference/i18n.md).

## Quick start

### macOS / Linux

```bash
./start-gui.sh
```

### Windows

```powershell
.\start-gui.ps1
```

The launcher creates `.venv`, installs `requirements.txt`, generates a local
session token, and prints the authenticated URL
`http://127.0.0.1:8123/?token=...`. Open that URL in a browser. No controller or
worker process is required for the demo backend.

The UI includes `/agent`, `/settings`, `/guide`, `/methods` and `/connectors`.
For a quick tour, read `START-HERE.md`; for screenshots, see `docs/showcase/`.

Run the test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

The recorded acceptance environment is Linux with Chrome CDP for browser e2e.
Windows hosts skip Linux-only cases and POSIX-fixture tests; use Linux for the
full acceptance record.

## Sharing with a team (WeChat)

For same-Wi-Fi teammates, run a dedicated demo instance on `0.0.0.0` with a
share-only token and send the LAN URL. For remote teammates, send the ZIP plus
`START-HERE.md`; or expose the demo instance through a temporary HTTPS tunnel.
Do not expose the local instance with a real provider key or real task history.
See [`SHARE-WECHAT.md`](SHARE-WECHAT.md) for the exact message template and
safety checklist.

## Verification and limitations

- **V4 is model-level.** It is a typed symbolic claim over the target function,
  not a binary-level whole-program proof.
- **M4 verifier and Lead approver are the same operator.** This is
  role-separated, not independent two-person review.
- **Review 9–12 original text is not recovered.** The verdict is against a
  canonical reconstruction.
- **Coverage is one public fixture family.** Other binaries, architectures,
  compilers and stripped production binaries are not covered.
- **No client binary, credential, private key or private log is included.**
- **Not a production product.** This is an accepted course/MVP deliverable.
